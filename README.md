Good day

This is project is made in Laravel 9 framework on Backend
and Vue JS 3 on Frontend

On Backend Side, I used service Layer Approach so 
this design pattern can easily understand by other developer

On Frontend Side, I use Option API of Vue JS since I am still not
familiar on composition API

I can say that this web app I made cant show all information
about the weather, but this provides all basic needs of the user.

This app also has a weather forecast that can give weather information
to users on following days.

I think most of the developers who took this
exam will directly access to 3rd party API using Frontend.
For now, I would like to focus more on how I build this
web app on the backend side, so I can cover all the flow,
from frontend, to backend.

Thank you

PS, I added short video for the output for UI.
